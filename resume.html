                    From age 4 I began training as a Gymnast, and am training as an Elite-Level Rhythmic 
                    Gymnast currently at Aurora Gymnastics. This sport has taught me resilience and 
                    patience as well as developing great relationships with coaches, peers and rapport 
                    with gymnasts that I coach. It has also given me great commitment skills which have 
                    been reflected into other areas of my life.
