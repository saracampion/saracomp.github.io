                <p>
                    Ensure learning is engaging and relevant for all students. E.g. provide visual aids and 
                    clear instructions for student 3 to help them stay on task.

                <p>These tier 1 intervention strategies are supported by the PBS framework highlighting the 
                    importance of a structures and engaging classroom environment. By setting clear 
                    expectations and routines provides predictability and reduces uncertainty in the 
                    classroom, preventing undesired behaviour. Positive reinforcement encourages desired 
                    behaviours whilst supporting the overall engagement of all students. Ensuring students 
                    stay focused and engaged, by providing visual aids, aligns with PBS’s aim of fostering 
                    supportive learning environments. Gentle, non-disruptive reminders of classroom rules 
                    and expectations help to manage behaviour in and unobtrusive way, ultimately contributing 
                    to the positive learning environment.
                    In the context of Dreikurs’ Goal Theory, students’ basic needs for attention, power, 
                    revenge and escape can be addressed by tier 1 strategies. By establishing a structure 
                    learning environment with clear rules and expectations helps in preventing undesired 
                    behaviours driven by power or attention seeking. Students needs for attention can be 
                    met positively by positive reinforcement, reducing the need for them to “act out” to 
                    gain attention. To help reduce students fear of failure, providing additional aids and 
                    giving engaging instruction allows the tasks to be more accessible for students, 
                    addressing escape behaviours.</p>

                    Provide student 1 with advanced tasks requiring increased intellectual stimulation to 
                    keep them engaged. E.g. extension activities, complex problem-solving tasks. This 
                    student should be encouraged to participate in enrichment programs to increase their 
                    motivation and decrease disengagement and disruptive behaviour. Schedule meetings to 
                    discuss the student’s interest and progress so they feel valued and heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Student 2 should have a structured break routine, where they can have planned, short 
                    breaks to regain energy and focus on the class work. Visual schedules or timers can be 
                    used to manage this routine. Create a behavioural contract with the student and a 
                    higher authority to set goals for specific behaviours and progress in class, with a 
                    reward system. This will help them to keep their focus and have something to work 
                    towards. Physical cues are important to help the student to stay focused, e.g. colour 
                    cards to show when it’s time to change activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Student 3 should participate in guided social skills training to help navigate interactions 
                    with their peers more successfully. E.g. scenarios and practicing appropriate responses. 
                    The use of quiet spaces and sensory tools will help this student manage any sensory 
                    overloads that may occur which will help them maintain their focus. Clear communication
                    and visual aids will help this student to better understand transitions and 
                    expectations. Visual timetables can be used for them to anticipate and get ready for 
                    any changes in their routine.

                    PBS aims to address the learning needs of student with learning difficulties. 
                    Incorporating structured rest breaks into students’ routines helps to keep students on 
                    task and maintain focus. Behavioural contracts written collaboratively by the student 
                    and teacher ensure the student understands the in their own words the expectations of 
                    them. Setting these goals for a student will help them to maintain their focus. 
                    Challenging activities help better engage students preventing disruptive behaviour 
                    stemming from boredom. In the context pf Dreikurs’ Goal Theory, structured breaks in 
                    the student’s routine allows the student to move around removing the need for power 
                    arising from being forced to sit still for long periods at a time, reducing undesired 
                    behaviour from occurring. Students’ senses of empowerment is increased when developing 
                    behaviour contracts with their teachers, as they feel like they have a sense of control 
                    over their expectations and the rewards they have the opportunity to obtain, addressing 
                    their need for power in a positive and constructive way. Giving students the opportunity 
                    to excel and expand their knowledge and skills recognises their need for attention 
                    reducing the need for them to participate in disruptive behaviour to gain that need. 
                    Escape behaviours can be reduced by providing students with sensory accommodations 
                    avoiding any overwhelming sensory inputs. These accommodations can help students to be 
                    more focus and feel a sense of safety when they are in the classroom, fostering a 
                    learning environment that is both positive and inclusive.

                    With student 1, collaboratively create a personalised learning plan that includes both 
                    challenging tasks and self-directed learning to ensure that they are being adequately 
                    challenging. E.g. expert in a field of interest. This student should be enrolled in 
                    enrichment programs and extra-curricular activities that they are interest in. This 
                    student’s engagement will increase and as they are participating in activities that are
                    relevant for them. Meeting with a school counsellor can help this student to discuss 
                    why they are feeling bored and disengaged and can work together to create preventative
                    strategies for these feelings.

                    Student 2 is provided with a support teacher to help them maintain their focus on the 
                    content and help them better understand what is in front of them. The individualised 
                    attention will help prevent this student from participating in undesired behaviours. 
                    Ensure the learning environment has flexibility, allowing this student to have some 
                    movement during their learning, e.g. standing desks, wiggle seats, to accommodate for 
                    their need for physical activity to help ten regain their focus.

                <p>
                    Include sensory tools and strategies that are easily accessible in student 3’s learning
                    to help manage any sensory overload, e.g. quiet space, headphones, fidget tools. 
                    Incorporate social strategies to help the student navigate socialising with their 
                    peers and other teaching staff. Teach social skills and appropriate behaviour, with 
                    specialised instruction techniques. Work with specialists to create a behaviour 
                    intervention plan (BIP) tailored to this student.

                    PBS has a main focus on proactive, individualised and supportive strategies to manage 
                    quite challenging, repetitive behaviour. It highlight the importance of tailoring 
                    interventions relent for the needs of different learning needs for all students. 
                    Fostering supportive and structed learning environments will enhance the engagement of 
                    all students by addressing the root cause of the behaviour. In the context of Dreikurs’
                    Goal Theory these tier 3 intervention strategies provide students with the desired 
                    feelings on attention power and escape, by providing structure and intellectual 
                    challenge. By incorporating these strategies into the classroom these students will 
                    feel supported, reducing the opportunity to participate in disruptive behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PBS supports these intervention strategies by highlighting the importance for both the 
                    school community and parents/carers in being consistent and transparent when 
                    communicating with one another. Seeking parents/carers input promotes collaborative 
                    behaviour management to support the student’s success in all aspects of their lives. 
                    Educators can better understand the needs of students by using empathetic language to 
                    address what their behaviour is driven by, supporting Dreikurs’ Goal Theory. Highlighting 
                    the strengths of students focuses on encouraging desired behaviour through a mutual 
                    understanding and respect.
