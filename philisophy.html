                    I want to be a fun teacher that students are excited to learn from. I want to be able 
                    to foster a classroom environment that is both creative and inclusive. I want all of 
                    my students to feel like they can have fun in my classroom, whist maintaining safe 
                    classroom procedures, and also feel like they are able to succeed in all areas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Technology and Applied Studies (TAS) is a very practical area of learning, this 
                    encourages many students to choose TAS subjects as they get to be creative and make 
                    projects that they are able to take home and show their family and friends, projects 
                    that they are really proud of. TAS classrooms can be quite dangerous as students are 
                    handling tools and machinery that can cause significant injuries. To ensure students 
                    remain safe at all times, students must follow set safety procedures that are put in 
                    place otherwise they will be unable to participate in practical classes. TAS can also 
                    be quite a challenging subject as students may be unfamiliar with the tools and 
                    machinery used. This unfamiliarity can lead to a lack of engagement. To avoid this, 
                    students who are feeling particularly challenged would be provided with greater 
                    scaffolding to complete projects for example, explicit / step-by-step instructions so 
                    they feel less overwhelmed about what they need to do.
