                    <p>Hello! I’m Sara Campion, a student teacher in my third year of university at 
                        Australian Catholic University. I am committed to fostering a classroom culture 
                        where every student has the potential to succeed and thrive. I am completing a 
                        double degree of a Bachelor of Education (Secondary) and a Bachelor of Arts 
                        (Design Innovation and Technologies). I have completed three teaching placements 
                        in both the government system and the Sydney Catholic School System. On my 
                        placements I have taught lessons that are engaging for all learners as I 
                        incorporated different teaching methods. Throughout my university study and on my 
                        teaching practicums I have developed units of work and lesson plans that have been 
                        beneficial for my teaching, so that I had structured lessons that were well paced 
                        and beneficial for student learning and engagement. </p>

                        My major subject area is textiles, which I have a great passion in. I have been 
                        creating textile projects since I was about 8 years old, ranging from knitting, 
                        crochet, embroidery, hand sewing, and more recently creating garments for both 
                        myself and friends that have been worn to weddings, parties, and more. I have also 
                        produced leotards for myself for rhythmic gymnastics competitions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At university I have completed 4 textiles units (one still in progress). The first
                         unit aimed at a technology mandatory (year 7 & 8) level of sewing. In this unit 
                         we produce a pyjama set and a small tote bag. This class helped people to gain a 
                         basic set of textile skills and knowledge to be able to teach students in their 
                         future careers. The next two textile units I completed were aimed at a stage 5 
                         level (year 9 & 10), where we produced two art quilts, and leather products. 
                         During the creating of the art quilt, we learnt different dying methods and 
                         surface embellishment techniques to produce decorative quilts that began as a 
                         white piece of fabric. The leatherwork unit was the first time I had worked with 
                         leather, so I gained a large amount of knowledge of the origins of leather 
                         products and how to work with leather. I then was able to produce a leather coin 
                         pouch/bag. I am currently undertaking my major unit aimed at a stage 6 level (year 
                         11 & 12) in textiles where I have to produce a major project, similar to a HSC 
                         major project. I am producing a rhythmic gymnastics unitard. I have not yet 
                         developed this project, however, I am in the testing stage to develop samples of 
                         the elements that I intend to include in the final product. This testing allows me 
                         to refine my skills and techniques to ensure that the final product has a 
                         professional finish before putting it on display in the exhibition at the end of 
                         this semester.

                    <p>
                        One of my minor subject areas is industrial technology, which includes both timber 
                        and metal work. Prior to starting my university studies, I had very minimal 
                        experience in industrial technology, the only experience being in year 7…which was 
                        roughly 10 years ago. Now that I have completed multiple units in this area, I have 
                        gain great confidence in the use of machines and various techniques that are 
                        involved in producing the projects in these subject areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first unit in completed was aimed at a technology mandatory level (year 7 & 8), 
                        where we produced a pencil box, a soup ladle, a rubber band car, and a desk lamp. These 
                        projects were extremely helpful in refining the basics of timber and metal work so that 
                        I could successfully participate in further units. The next unit I completed was a 
                        timber unit, where I was able to expand my skills in wood working to successfully 
                        produce a chopping board, a stool, and an heirloom box. These three projects all 
                        use different techniques that I had never done before so I was able to broaden my 
                        knowledge of timber techniques. Initially I was nervous to complete these projects 
                        but once I got going, I had lots of fun making things that I could take home and 
                        show my family. I am currently undertaking a metal work unit. I feel very nervous 
                        in this unit as it is quite particular and everything must be exact, however my 
                        confidence is growing as the unit progresses. We are producing multiple projects 
                        including a hacksaw, a hammer, and a toolbox. These projects are still in the works,
                        so I do not have any photos.

                        All of these projects that I have made in my studies are great teaching samples 
                        that I will be able to take into my future career and show my students what they 
                        could potentially produce as well.
